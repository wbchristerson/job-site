        This project is a flashcard application for Android mobile devices in
        which users may create collections of flashcards and quiz themselves on
        the decks that they compile. I created the application using
        <code>react-native</code> along with <code>redux</code>. (This project

              As said above, the application begins with a tab navigator
              composed of two screens. The first is a list view of all currently
              available flashcard decks. As a starting point, two decks are
              already provided: "Spanish" (9 cards) and "Architecture" (2 cards)
              . You may quiz yourself with these or add new decks.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second screen in the tab navigator is a form to add an
              additional deck ("new deck"). Submitting the form will take the
              user to the new page for that deck.
            </p>

              alt="A screenshot of the game's new deck page">

            <p>
              Individual deck pages can be reached by clicking on a deck from
              the list view. This lists the name of the deck, the number of
              cards, and buttons for adding a card to the deck as well as for
              quizzing one's self.
            </p>

            <p>
              The "new card" form is similar to the "new deck" form.

            <p>
              The quiz page displays the deck questions in order with an
              available button to check the answer and then grade one's self.
              Clicking the answer field will reveal the answer to the given
              question. When the user finishes looking through the deck, his/her
              score is shown.

              <li>Right click and choose "Extract All" then extract.</li>

            In all cases, having downloaded the files:

              <li>To install all dependencies from the command line, run the

                  <div class="clone-command">

              <li>In another terminal window, run the following command to start
                the project:
                <code class="display-code">
                  <div class="clone-command">

            </ul>

            <p>The terminal will then provide you with several options. If you
              have the application
              <a class="inner-link"

                target="_blank">
                Expo</a> on your device, then you can scan the accompanying QR
              code that appears. This will give you the option to run the
              application on mobile (note: the scan is most easily executed on
              terminals with a black background and a gray or white foreground).
