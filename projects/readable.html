        This project is a forum (content/comment) application in which users may
        post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other
        users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. The backend server for
        storing information was provided by Udacity. I made the rest of the
        application using <code>create-react-app</code> along with React and
        Redux.

                to a page listing all posts of that category.</li>
              <li>The project opens with a main page listing all currently
                published posts. There are options at the top of the page for
                the order of presentation of posts, by date of latest
                modification as well as by net number of votes. There are also
                options for composing a new post, with a button that opens a
                modal for such creation.</li>
              <li>Clicking on any post takes the user to a page for that

              <li>Each post itself has a sample avatar image, a title, and

                a post as well as to delete it. Selecting editing will open a
                modal similar to the composition modal. On the far left side of
                each post there are also buttons for increasing and decreasing
                the vote count for a particular post.</li>

              Python must be installed on your computer to run the application.
              If you do not have it installed, you can download it for free. For
              details, see
              <a class="inner-link"

              created using Python version 3.1.

            <p>
              If you are running an operating system other than Windows, then
              you may have to download and install additional software to
              accommodate the Tkinter toolkit. To learn more or to trouble
              shoot, see these pages:

            </ul>

            <p>
              To download the project, you can clone the repository using this
              terminal command:
            </p>

            <code class="display-code">
              <div class="clone-command">
                git clone https://github.com/wbchristerson/database.git
              </div>
            </code>

            <p>
              Alternatively, follow the instructions below to download to a hard
              drive:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Navigate to
                <a class="inner-link"
                   href="https://github.com/wbchristerson/database"
                   target="_blank">

                  page.
              </li>
              <li>Click the green "Clone or download" button towards the right then choose "Download ZIP".</li>
              <li>Find the folder <code>database-master</code> in your Downloads folder or wherever it was placed on your device.</li>
              <li>Right click and choose "Extract All"</li>
              <li>Go to <code>database-master</code>, enter <code>database-master</code> again, then double click <code>database.py</code>. The menu will appear.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Note: The project comes with sample database entries to illustrate
              how the application works. If you wish to delete these entries and
              begin with a completely blank database, double click the file
              <code>delete_database.py</code>. A window will open, prompting you
              to confirm that you wish to delete all existing entries. To
              continue, type 'y'. To cancel, type 'n'. For a more aesthetically
              pleasing presentation of the original problems in the database,
              see <code>sample_problems.pdf</code>.
